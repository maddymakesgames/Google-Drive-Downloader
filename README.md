This project isn't getting updated really.

This project allows you to download files from a google account's google drive without using the official Google API library or going to drive.google.com.

There are two versions of this downloader, a command line interface, and a gui version.
If you want to use the cli, after compiling, type `node ./dist/cli.js <options>`
To use the gui, if you're on linux, type `npm start`, I'm currently to lazy to make a windows execute script but if you wanted to change it, you wouldn't have to change much.

To setup and compile type `npm install`, `npm install typescript`, and then  `tsc .`, the outputted files will appear in the dist/ directory.

Go wild
